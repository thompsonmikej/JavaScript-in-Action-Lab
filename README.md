# JavaScript-in-Action

**Developed at devCodeCamp**

This project is a comprehensive introduction to foundational JavaScript concepts including variables, conditionals, user input, and debugging. Through a series of hands-on tasks, practiced working with dynamic data, control flow, and the browser debugger tools to gain programming skills.

---

## Description

### Tasks Include

- **Task 1: Days of the Week**  
  - Create and reassign variables  
  - Use `console.log()` to output values  
  - Debug code using browser breakpoints and step-through functionality  

- **Task 2: User Input**  
  - Collect user input via `prompt()`  
  - Combine inputs into a dynamic output string  

- **Task 3: Meals & Conditionals**  
  - Implement conditional logic based on time values  
  - Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to assign meal variables  
  - Test edge cases and error handling by intentionally using invalid input  
  - Practice using breakpoints and debuggers to inspect code execution  

And more tasks.

## Features

- Variables and dynamic reassignment  
- User input handling with `prompt()`  
- Conditional statements with multiple branches  
- Console output for debugging and feedback  
- Debugger usage: breakpoints, step-through, and variable inspection  
- Foundational JavaScript building blocks: variables, conditionals, debugging

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/thompsonmikej/JavaScript-in-Action.git
    cd JavaScript-in-Action
    ```

2. **Open the `index.html` or `.js` file in your browser** using a local server or simply by double-clicking.

3. **Open the browser DevTools Console and Debugger** to run and step through the code.

---

## Usage

- Follow the step-by-step tasks detailed in the script to practice JavaScript fundamentals.  
- Use browser debugging tools to set breakpoints and inspect variables as the code runs.  
- Experiment by changing variable values and observe conditional flow and error handling.

---

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Learned core JavaScript concepts: variables, conditionals, string manipulation, and user input.  
- Gained practical experience using browser debugging tools to trace and fix issues.  
- Developed confidence in reading, understanding, and modifying JavaScript code.

---

## Future Improvements

- Extend to include loops, functions, and array manipulations.  
- Integrate automated tests for input validation and output correctness.  
- Add user interface elements for interactive input/output instead of prompt/console.
